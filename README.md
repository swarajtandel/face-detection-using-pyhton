# face-detection-using-pyhton

This code continuously captures frames from your webcam, detects faces in each frame, and draws rectangles around the detected faces. Press 'q' to quit the application.

Make sure you have OpenCV installed (pip install opencv-python) before running the code. Also, ensure your webcam is properly connected and functional. You may need to adjust the scaleFactor, minNeighbors, and minSize parameters of the detectMultiScale function for better face detection based on your webcam's resolution and lighting conditions.
